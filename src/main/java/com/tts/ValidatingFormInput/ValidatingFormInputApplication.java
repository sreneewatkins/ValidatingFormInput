/*
To activate Spring MVC, you would normally add @EnableWebMvc to the Application class.
But Spring Bootâ€™s @SpringBootApplication already adds this annotation when it detects
spring-webmvc on your classpath. This same annotation lets it find the annotated
@Controller class and its methods.
The Thymeleaf configuration is also taken care of by @SpringBootApplication. By default,
templates are located in the classpath under templates/ and are resolved as views by
stripping the '.html' suffix off the file name.
